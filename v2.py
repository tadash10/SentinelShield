def monitor_network_traffic():
    # Code to monitor network traffic in real-time
    # This can involve capturing and analyzing network packets, applying machine learning or rule-based techniques for anomaly detection

    # Code to monitor system logs in real-time
    # This can involve parsing and analyzing log files, identifying patterns or indicators of compromise

    # Code to detect potential security breaches or suspicious activities
    # This can involve correlating network traffic and system logs, applying intrusion detection algorithms or rules

    # Code to backup network traffic logs and system logs for future reference and analysis
    # This can involve creating copies of log files or sending logs to a secure storage location
