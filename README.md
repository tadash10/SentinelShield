# Real-time Intrusion Detection and Response

This Python script provides real-time intrusion detection and response capabilities by monitoring network traffic and system logs. It applies machine learning or rule-based techniques to detect potential security breaches or suspicious activities. Upon detection, it triggers automated responses to mitigate the risks and initiate incident response procedures compliant with ISO 27035.

## Features

- Real-time monitoring of network traffic and system logs
- Detection of potential security breaches or suspicious activities
- Automated responses, such as blocking attacker's IP, alerting the security team, and initiating incident response
- Backup of logs and updating firewall rules
- In-depth analysis of intrusions and mitigation measures
- Integration with email to send alert notifications

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tadash10/SentinelShield/tree/main
   cd real-time-intrusion-detection
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended): 
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
Install the required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the script:python intrusion_detection.py
    The script will start monitoring network traffic and system logs in real-time.

    Upon detecting potential intrusions or suspicious activities, the script will trigger automated responses and initiate incident response procedures.

    Adjust the monitoring interval and other settings as needed in the intrusion_detection.py script.
