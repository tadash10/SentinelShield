    # Code to detect potential security breaches or suspicious activities
    # This can involve correlating network traffic and system logs, applying intrusion detection algorithms or rules

def block_attacker_ip(ip_address):
    # Code to block the attacker's IP address using appropriate firewall or network security measures
    # This can involve modifying firewall rules or using an API to update network configurations
